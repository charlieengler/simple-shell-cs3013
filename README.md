This project was completed for Mark Sheahan's CS 3013 (Operating Systems) course at Worcester Polytechnic Insitute. Most of the starter code, including the abstract syntax tree, was written by Professor Sheahan and can be seen at the point of "Initial Commit". I implemented all other logic and data structures in subsequent commits.
